# Roadmap
The roadmap is a living document, and it is likely that priorities will change,
but the list below should give some indication of our plans for
the next release, and for the future.

 - Audio support (probably using OpenAL)
 - Serialize / Deserialize (Save Staates)
 - Scale Up/Down controls
 - CLI usage (currently games must be opened via File menu)
